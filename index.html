# Meet HAL 9000

---
class: top
## 2001: A Space Odyssey
  * Classic science fiction movie from **1969**;
  * Part of the story centers around an intelligent computer called HAL
.red[HAL] - .red[**H**]euristically programmed .red[**AL**]gorithmic computer  
  * HAL is the “brains” of an intelligent spaceship
  * in the movie, HAL can
    + speak easily with the crew
    + see and understand the emotions of the crew
    + navigate the ship automatically
    + diagnose on-board problems
    + make life-and-death decisions
    + display emotions
    
**In 1969 this was science fiction: is it still science fiction?**

???
* HAL is the imidiate letters after IBM;

# Can we build hardware as complex as the brain?
## How complicated is our brain?
* a neuron, or nerve cell, is the basic information processing unit
* estimated to be on the order of `\(10^{12}\)` neurons in a human brain
* many more synapses ( `\(10^{14}\)` ) connecting these neurons
* cycle time: `\(10^{-3}\)` seconds (1 millisecond)

---
class: top
# Can we build hardware as complex as the brain?
## How complex can we make computers?
* ~ 730k transistors per CPU 
* supercomputer: millions of CPUs, `\(10^7\)` GB of RAM 
* cycle times: order of `\(10^{-9}\)` seconds

---
class: top
# Can we build hardware as complex as the brain?
## Conclusion
* .red[YES]: we can have computers with as many basic processing elements as our brain;
* far fewer interconnections (wires or synapses) than the brain
* much faster updates than the brain
* **but building hardware is very different from making a computer behave like a brain!**

# Must an Intelligent System be Foolproof?
* A “foolproof” system is one that never makes an error:
  + Types of possible computer errors
    + hardware errors, e.g., memory errors
    + software errors, e.g., coding bugs
    + “human-like” errors
  + Clearly, hardware and software errors are possible in practice
  + what about “human-like” errors?

---
class: top
# Must an Intelligent System be Foolproof?
## An intelligent system can make errors and still be intelligent
* humans are not right all of the time
* we learn and adapt from making mistakes
  + e.g., consider learning to surf or ski
    + we improve by taking risks and falling
    + an intelligent system can learn in the same way

## Conclusion:
.red[NO]: **intelligent systems will not (and need not) be foolproof**

# What is AI? 
&lt;img src="images/AI_defs.png" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???
* Modeling exactly how humans actually think 
  + cognitive models of human reasoning 
* Modeling exactly how humans actually act
  + models of human behavior (what they do, not how they think)
* Modeling how ideal agents “should think”
  + models of “rational” thought (formal logic)
  + note: humans are often not rational!
* Modeling how ideal agents “should act” 
  + rational actions but not necessarily formal rational reasoning
  + i.e., more of a black-box/engineering approach
* Modern AI focuses on the last definition
  + modern methods are inspired by cognitive &amp; neuroscience (how people think).

* Mathematics
* Economics
* Neuroscience
* Psychology

**John McCarthy- coined the term- 1950’s**

---
class: middle
# A little bit of history
## Philosophy
* Dealt with questions like: 
  + Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?
  + Where does knowledge come from? How does it lead to action?
* Aristotle
  + Given the end to achieve
  + Consider by what means to achieve it
  + Consider how the above will be achieved …till you reach the first cause
  + Last in the order of analysis = First in the order of action
  + If you reach an impossibility, abandon search

---
class: middle
# A little bit of history
## Mathematics
* Boolean Logic(mid 1800’s)
* Intractability (1960’s)
  + Polynomial Vs Exponential growth
  + Intelligent behaviour = tractable subproblems, not large intractable problems.
* Probability
  + Gerolamo Cardano(1500’s) - probability in terms of outcomes of gambling events

---
class: middle
# A little bit of history
## Economics
* How do we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?
* How do we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?
* Game Theory (mid 1900’s)

---
class: middle
# A little bit of history
## Neuroscience
* Study of the nervous system, esp. brain
* A collection of simple cells can lead to thought and action
* Cycle time: 
  + Human brain - microseconds
  + Computers - nanoseconds
* The brain is still 100,000 times faster

---
class: middle
# A little bit of history
## Psychology
* Behaviourism:
  + stimulus leads to response
* Cognitive science
  + Computer models can be used to understand the psychology of memory, language and thinking
  + The brain is now thought of in terms of computer science constructs like I/O units, and processing center

# Machines that think like humans 
* Determine **how** humans think;
* Get inside the actual workings of human minds;
    + **Introspection** - catch our own thoughts as they go by;
    + **Psychological experiments**;
* Sufficiently precise theory of the mind:
    + Express the theory as a computer program;

---
class: middle    
# Machines that think like humans 

&gt; If the program's input/output and timing behavior matches human behavior, that is evidence that some of the program's mechanisms may also be operating in humans;

---
class: middle
# Machines that think like humans 

* How do we know how humans think?
* **Program correctly solving problems is not enough!**
    + Comparing the trace of its reasoning steps to traces of human subjects solving the same problems;
* **Cognitive science**: computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology 
    + Precise and testable theories of the workings of the human mind;
    + Vision, natural language, and learning;

---
class: middle
# Machines that think like humans

&gt; The exciting new effort to make computers think ... machines with minds, in the full and literal sense. (Haugeland, 1985)

&gt; The automation of activities that we associate with human thinking, activities such as decision-making, problem solving, learning ... (Bellman, 1978)


---
class: middle

# Machines that act like humans 
* **Intelligent behavior** as the ability to achieve **human-level performance** in all cognitive tasks, **sufficient to fool an interrogator**.

# The Turing Test 
&lt;img src="images/turing-test.jpg" width="400px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
 
---
class: middle

# The Turing Test 
* Uses the "Imitation Game"
* Usual method:
    + Three people play (man, woman, and interrogator)
    + Interrogator determines which of the other two is a woman by asking questions
        + Example: How long is your hair?
    + Typewritten or repeated by an intermediary

---
class: middle
# The Turing Test 
* Requires success in:
    + Natural language processing: **communicate** with the interrogator;
    + Knowledge representation: store and retrieve **what it knows**;
    + Automated reasoning: use the stored information to answer questions and to **draw new conclusions**;
    + Machine learning: **adapt to new circumstances** and to detect and extrapolate patterns

---
class: middle
# The Turing Test
* Not a big effort to try to pass the Turing test;
* Acting like a human: 
    + When AI programs have to interact with people
    + e.g. when an expert system explains how it came to its diagnosis;
    + e.g. natural language processing system has a dialogue with a user. 
* When programs must behave according to certain normal conventions of human interaction?
* Underlying representation and reasoning **may or may not be based on a human model**.

#Machines that act like humans 

&gt;The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people. (Kurzweil)

&gt;The study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better. (Rich and Knight)


---
class: middle
# Machines that think rationally
* Aristotle was one of the first to attempt to codify **right thinking**
    + Irrefutable reasoning processes;
    + **Syllogisms**: patterns for argument structures: always gave correct conclusions given correct premises;
    + Laws of thought supposed to govern the operation of the mind
* Formal logic provide a precise notation for statements about all kinds of things in the world and the relations between them;

---
class: middle
# Machines that think rationally

* Humans are not always rational.
    + Big difference between being able to solve a problem and doing so;
* Rational - defined in terms of logic?
* Logic can't express everything: informal knowledge, knowledge is less than 100% certain;
* Logical approach is often not feasible in terms of computation time (needs *guidance*)

---
class: middle
# Machines that think rationally 
&gt;The study of mental faculties through the use of computational models. (Charniak and McDermott, 1985)

&gt;The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act. (Winston, 1992)

---
class: middle
# Machines that act rationally 
* Rational behavior: doing the right thing;
* The right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information;
* Correct inference is not all of rationality:
    + Situations where there is no provably correct thing to do, yet something must still be done;
    + Ways of acting rationally that cannot be reasonably said to involve inference:
        + pulling one's hand off of a hot stove is a **reflex** action that is more successful than a slower action taken after careful deliberation;

---
class: middle        
# Machines that act rationally 

&gt; A field of study that seeks to explain and emulate intelligent behavior in terms of computational processes. (Schalkoff, 1990)

&gt; The branch of computer science that is concerned with the automation of intelligent behavior. (Luger and Stubblefield, 1993)
